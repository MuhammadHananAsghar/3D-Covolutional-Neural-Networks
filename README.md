# 3D ConvNet
A 3D CNN is simply the 3D equivalent: it takes as input a 3D volume or a sequence of 2D frames (e.g. slices in a CT scan), 3D CNNs are a powerful model for learning representations for volumetric data.

## Use Case of 3D CNN
A 3D Convolution can be used to find patterns across 3 spatial dimensions; i.e. depth, height and width. One effective use of 3D Convolutions is object segmentation in 3D medical imaging. Since a 3D model is constructed from the medical image slices, this is a natural fit.

## When should a 3D CNN is used?
Most CNN models that learn from video data almost always have 3D CNN as a low level feature extractor. Show activity on this post. 3D convolutions should be used when you want to extract spatial features from your input on 3 dimensions. For computer vision, they are typically used on volumetric images, which are 3D.
